                <p>Grungle is a quirky card game based on the rock, paper, scissors format.<br>
                    - A grid is generated from a deck of 21 cards.<br>
                    - The goal of the player is to accumulate points by selecting cards to battle.<br>
                    - The outcome of each card battle is resolved through some simple rules.<br>
                    - The 21 card deck is made up of 3 suits. The Dragon, The Kraken and the Unicorn.<br>
                    - Dragon beats Kraken. Kraken beats Unicorn and Unicorn beats Dragon.<br>
                    - Each card from each suit has a value ranging from 1 to 7.<br>
                    - If the winning cards value is higher than the losing card, the difference in value is added as points to the player.<br>
                    - If the winning cards value is lower than the losing card, the difference is deducted in points from the player.<br>
                    - If the cards are the same suit. Then no points are won or deducted.<br>
                    - After each battle, the cards are removed from the board.<br>
